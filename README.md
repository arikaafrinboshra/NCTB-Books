### Project Objective:
● Build the project as straightforward as possible.
● Provide necessary functionality which is essential for the user.
● Provide library facilities.
● Provide download mechanism.
● Provide a better user interface.
● Provide services offline.

### Aim:
The aim of this project is to make a mobile application that can be downloaded and used in an iOS device to get the books which is proposed and provided by NCTB as a pdf or digital textbook version that can be read and downloaded through the application. NCTB Books are often found in websites and play stores as an android app. But there is no complete and reliable NCTB Book app found in app store iOS platform. So our aim is to develop the app and upload it in the app store and serve our iOS user.

### Software Development Model for our project:
There are various approach for software development. Various model is used across many organisation in industry such as scrum, waterfall, spiral etc. Our project is “NCTB Books”. We have decided to use agile model to develop our software.

At the starting of the application we will see a view for some milliseconds. This view or screen is called splash screen or launch screen. It will always occur at the starting of the application and view for some milliseconds.

**Home Screen:**

After the splash view we are automatically navigated to the home screen . Here we will see at the top a cover photo, in the middle section class wise categorized digital book section and at the end level we will see the tab bar.
Cover Photo- It is implemented only for better view.
Book Section- Here users can find their books according to their education level. Tab Bar- Here user can switch to another page or screen or view if he/she wants.

**List Screen:**

**Top Level Design of the System:**

In acquisition-oriented systems engineering, a top-level system design represents the envisioned implementation of a system in sufficient detail to support credible projections of cost, schedule, performance, evolution, and risk. A top-level system design can be used to assess system feasibility at the outset of a program, as a basis for performing analyses of alternatives, and as a tool to help finalize requirements and budgets prior to a system development contract solicitation. When developed with careful consideration of its purpose, the top-level system design becomes the program's early technical baseline for acquisition planning activities.
Top-Level Design is both a design concept and a design method. Unlike software engineering, information resource planning and technology road maps, Top-level Design as a design method is not clearly defined in terms of its contents and methods.

**System Diagram:**

A system diagram is a visual ​model​ of a ​system​, its components, and their interactions. With supporting documentation, it can capture all the essential information of a system's design. There are many variations of diagramming style that all fall under this rubric. The style presented here is intended to be optimally consistent with the rest of this courseware.

**Use Case Diagrams:**

A use case diagram at its simplest is a representation of a user's interaction with the system that shows the relationship between the user and the different use cases in which the user is involved. A use case diagram can identify the different types of users of a system and the different use cases and will often be accompanied by other types of diagrams as well. The use cases are represented by either circles or ellipses.

**Flow Chart:**

A ​flowchart​ is a type of ​diagram​ that represents a ​workflow​ or ​process​. A flowchart can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an ​algorithm​, a step-by-step approach to solving a task. The flowchart shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a
solution model to a given ​problem​. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields.
